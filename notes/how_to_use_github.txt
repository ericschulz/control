type commands beginning with 'git' into the terminal


To push from local to remote version of branch:

open terminal

go to control folder

git add .  -- adds (and removes?) all the files in the folders to the local git repository's index so they can then be pushed to the remote repository

git commit -m "Test 3" — ‘stages’ these changes ready to push to the other branch?
